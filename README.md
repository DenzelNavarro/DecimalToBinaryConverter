#Decimal to Binary Converter

This project is a simple Decimal to Binary Converter that uses recursion to transform a decimal number into its binary equivalent. It includes an animation that visually represents the recursion process, helping users understand how the algorithm works step-by-step.

##How It Works
1. The user inputs a decimal number.
2. Upon clicking the "Convert" button, the program recursively calculates the binary equivalent of the inputted decimal.
3. If the user inputs the number 5, for example, the binary conversion process would start and show the breakdown of recursive steps until the solution is reached.
4. The animation provides a visual representation of the recursive calls, allowing users to follow the process in an easy-to-understand way.

##Key Learning Points
Through this project, I learned:

- Recursion: The process of solving a problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems, and applying the same logic until the base case is reached.
- How to simplify complex problems and reduce them into straightforward tasks, making them easier to solve programmatically.
- Implementing visual animations to represent recursive steps and make abstract concepts more tangible.
